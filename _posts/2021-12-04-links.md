### Stock Market Project

You could download the entire stock market data to a database. Yahoo has a decent API that includes international markets. Just the US and Canada data set is 10,000 plus stocks. And start looking for stocks going up or down the most. That's what I did. Unless, you're paying for such service most people don't have access to such information even though is free. This gives you a leg up over other investor e.g. in Reddit of a few days before they catch up. Useful specially for finding SPACs in their way up before announcements or shortly after but still ahead of the crowd.

If you got R then run a classification algorithm once or twice a year when Indexes like the Russell rebalance. Because hedge funds and ETFs that follow indexes have to buy shares on the new companies added and dropped after rebalancing the prices in such companies experience a quick upward or downward price change. A company added to the Russell 3000 can see an increase sometimes up to 50% because they are relatively small and the number of shares traded is a relatively large during the reindexing. So, you can make money both ways with options going long or short (with the companies dropped from the index). All what you need is to run some classification algo to identify the most likely companies in or out of an index. 

Don't forget to use calls and puts strategically to limit your losses. It works like an insurance, they limit your upside potential a bit but protect you in case you missed a few.
