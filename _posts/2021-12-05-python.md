### Stock Market Project

Download the entire stock market dataset to a database. Yahoo has a decent API that includes international markets, but just the US and Canada data set is 10,000+ stocks. Use a tool like Python to collect the data and store it in an SQL database of your own design. Design trend reports looking for stocks going up or down the most. Keep the data up to date over time.
