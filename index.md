Hi, Iâ€™m Ashlin Ferguson, and I like Microsoft SQL Server.

This blog is ramblings, musings, and notes about my experience and career related to SQL database. It will be updated sporadically, when I feel like it.

I've been learning Microsoft SQL Server for a couple of decades and there's still always an interesting new challenge to tackle. Most recently I have been specializing in query and index performance tuning.
