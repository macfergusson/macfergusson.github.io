Hi, Iâ€™m macfergusson, I like Microsoft SQL Server.

This blog is ramblings, musings, and notes about my experience and career related to SQL database.

I've been learning Microsoft SQL Server for 15 years and there's still always an interesting new challenge to tackle. Most recently I have been specializing in query and index performance tuning.
